# Rain Prediction
This project applies logistic regression to a real-world weather dataset to predict whether it will rain tomorrow at a given location in Australia.

I'm currently learning machine learning, and this project is part of my hands-on practice with real datasets.

## Problem Statement
The dataset contains ~10 years of daily weather observations across Australia.  
> As a data scientist at the Bureau of Meteorology, you're tasked with creating a system that uses today's weather data to predict if it will rain tomorrow.

## About the Project

This notebook walks through the full process of a machine learning classification project:

- **Data exploration** and basic understanding of the dataset  
- **Data cleaning and preprocessing** including handling null values, converting categories, and feature selection  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with visualizations to spot trends and correlations  
- **Model building** using Logistic Regression from Scikit-learn  
- **Model evaluation** using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- **Result interpretation** through graphs and probability outputs

This project focuses on clarity, simplicity, and practical implementationâ€”ideal for learners like me who are just starting out in the ML domain.
